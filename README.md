## Repository structure

All analysis code and notebooks are located in the **`material/`** folder.  

### Preprocessing pipeline
- `material/RNA_preprocessing_ROSMAP_September_2025.ipynb` (normalization, identification of highly variable genes (HVGs))
- `material/merge_batches_by_cell_type_September_2025.py`  (cell-type aggregation)

### Figure 1–2
- `material/AD_PLS_analyses.ipynb` (replication of Hodgson, Li et al. (2024) https://doi.org/10.1038/s42003-024-06273-8)

### Figure 3–4
- `material/MT_PLS_analyses.ipynb` (mitochondrial PLS model fitting, classification models, gene set enrichment analysis)  
- `material/LINCS.ipynb` (drug perturbation analysis)  
- `material/upset_plots.ipynb` (gene set overlap)
- `material/MT_PLS` (all figures generated by these notebooks)
- `material/supplementary_tables` (supplementary tables showing the gene set enrichment anlysis results and overlap in gene sets between the drug and the enriched pathways)

### Figure 5
- `material/RADC.ipynb`  
  (associations with clinical and pathological markers from the Rush Alzheimer’s Disease Center)
- `material/RADC` (heatmaps for all 32 risk factors invetsigated can be found under)
    

### Figure 6
- `material/perturb_seq.ipynb` (CRISPRi loss-of-function perturbations)
- `material/CRISPR_perturbations` (perturbations most strongly mirrored by each gene module for each cell type)

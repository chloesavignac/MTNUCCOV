- Supplementary Table 1: GO molecular function pathway enrichment. We show all significant enrichment (FDR threshold of q=0.05) on the GO molecular function 2023 atlas for each gene module and cell type. 

- Supplementary Table 2: GO biological process pathway enrichment. We show all significant enrichment (FDR threshold of q=0.05) on the GO biological process 2023 atlas for each gene module and cell type.

- Supplementary Table 3: Overlap in gene set between drugs and enriched pathways. We show the overlap between leading genes from the perturbagen data (i.e., module genes that mirrored chemically perturbed signatures) and the leading genes identified by GSEA (i.e., genes driving pathways that passed the FDR threshold of q = 0.05) for the most prominent pathways at the molecular level. This table was used to generate the UpSet plot shown in Fig. 4C.
